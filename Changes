Revision history for Perl extension Text::Iconv.

0.01  Sat Aug 23 16:14:12 1997
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

1.0   Sun Feb 27 16:50:11 MET 2000
	- renamed to Text::Iconv.

1.1   Mon Dec 18 00:50:45 MET 2000
	- works with Perl 5.6
	- improved and expanded test script
	- fixes core dumps with aborted conversions
	- adds experimental class attribute/method raise_error

1.2   Fri Jul 27 10:46:56 METDST 2001
	- converting undef now always returns undef
	- since HP-UX seems to be the only platform where the second
	  argument to iconv() is *not* const char**, put an #ifdef
	  into Iconv.xs

1.3   Mon Jun 28 19:25:43 CEST 2004
	- Makefile.PL now tries to detect the need for -liconv
	- added retval() method to Text::Iconv objects, which returns the
	  iconv() return value (according to the Single UNIX Specification,
	  "the number of non-identical conversions performed")
	- to make this possible, Text::Iconv objects are--on the C level--no
	  longer just the iconv handle, but a struct (which can contain other
	  information besides the handle)

1.4   Sun Jul 18 00:09:21 CEST 2004
	- Added instance attribute raise_error and corresponding
	  method to control exception raising on a per-object basis.
	- Reset shift state for state-dependent conversions.
	- Makefile.PL now passes all options besides LIBS and INC to
	  MakeMaker, so options like INSTALLDIRS=vendor work again.
