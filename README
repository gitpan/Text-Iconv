Description
-----------

This module provides a Perl interface to the XPG4 iconv() function.
For more details see the POD documentation embedded in the file
Iconv.pm, which will also be installed as Text::Iconv(3) man page.

Prerequisites
-------------

Your system should be compliant with XPG4 or at least provide
iconv_open(), iconv() and iconv_close() functions compliant with XPG4.

Note that the possible conversions and the quality of the conversions
depend on the available iconv conversion tables and algorithms, which
are in most cases supplied by the operating system vendor.  Some
systems also allow you to build your own tables (e.g., HP-UX, Digital
UNIX, and AIX provide the genxlt(1) command).

Building the module
-------------------

Since XPG4 only specifies an interface, several issues are left to the
implementation to define, namely:

    1. The supported conversions
    2. The supported character sets
    3. The names for the supported character sets

Please check your system documentation for the above points.  You
might also have to link in a special library (AIX seems to require
this).  If this is the case, add it to the list of needed libraries in
Makefile.PL (e.g.: -liconv).

You might also have to change the character set names which are used
in the tests run by "make test".  See test.pl.

No changes are necessary for HP-UX systems.

The module can now be built using this sequence of commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test

Installation
------------

    make install

Feedback
--------

Locale::iconv was only tested on HP-UX 10.20.  If you are building the
module on another architecture I would appreciate a note to tell me
how you got on.  It would also be good to know what conversions and
character sets are supported by the different systems, so that the
tests could automatically select conversions which are known to be
supported on the specific system.
